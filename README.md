# Predictive Modeling for Health-Related Risk Assessment

## Research Topic
Our research focuses on developing predictive models for assessing health-related risks based on an individual's lifestyle, medical history, and demographic factors. Leveraging the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset with 19 variables, including general health, exercise habits, and disease history, our goal is to predict the likelihood of various health conditions, notably heart disease.

## SMART Questions
1. Can accurate predictive models determine an individual's risk of developing heart disease based on demographic, lifestyle, and medical history factors?
2. How do factors like exercise habits, alcohol consumption, and BMI contribute to the prediction of health conditions?
3. What is the impact of gender, age, and general health status on the risk assessment of various health conditions?

## Data Source
We utilize the [BRFSS dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alphiree/cardiovascular-diseases-risk-prediction-dataset/data), a comprehensive nationwide survey collecting health-related information from U.S. residents.

## Modeling Methods
We employ various machine learning and statistical methods, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machines
- Naive Bayes

Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Expected Outcomes
Our project aims to create predictive models for personalized healthcare, identifying individuals at higher risk of conditions like heart disease. These models can revolutionize healthcare with targeted interventions, early prevention, and improved resource allocation.
